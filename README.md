# Evaluator of Mathematical Expressions

<h3 align="left">How does it work?</h3>

- In the Start interface you will see a field for entering the mathematical equation.
- After entering the expression, press the "Calculate" button.
- Wait for the magic to happen! The ``Evaluator of Mathematical Expressions`` will give you the infix expression, the postfix one and not ultimately the result of the inserted expression.
  
-RULES!

- The expression given must contain only digits, linked (no spaces)
- The supported functions and operations are multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.
- Example of expression: 3-8/2*3+6/2-9*5+1
