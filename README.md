# Evaluator of Mathematical Expressions

<h3 align="left">How does it work?</h3>

- In the Start interface you will see a field for entering the mathematical equation.
- After entering the expression, press the "Calculate" button.
- Wait for the magic to happen! The ``Evaluator of Mathematical Expressions`` will give you the infix expression, the postfix one and not ultimately the result of the inserted expression.
  
-RULES!

- The expression given must contain only digits, linked (no spaces)
- The supported functions and operations are multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.
- Example of expression: 3-8/2*3+6/2-9*5+1

# Password Generator

<h3 align="left">How does it work? -> Here we have the project requirement:</h3>

Write an application that generates and displays on the screen a string representing a password that meets the following conditions:

- It will have a length between 12 and 18 characters.
- It will start with an uppercase letter.
- It will contain alphanumeric characters and at least one symbol from the set ("!", "?", "#", "@").
  
Depending on a parameter given at the command line, the generated password will either be composed of random characters that satisfy the above conditions or be constructed from words in a dictionary saved on disk in a .txt file.

<h5>Example input:</h5>

```./pass_gen``` </br>
```./pass_gen --dict dict.txt```
